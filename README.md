# gpaWebApp

This webApp is meant to be a subdomain on my website which will serve as a tool with which I can:
<p>
1. View my current gpa progress graph (data is taken from a database) </br>
2. Update my scores to an sql database </br>
3. clear the scores in the database
</p>
Once completed it should exist as gpa.kanhaprasad.com 

*This app uses the web.py application framework*
