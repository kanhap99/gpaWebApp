# gpaWebApp

This webApp is meant to be a subdomain on my website which will serve as a tool with which I can:
1. View my current gpa progress graph (data is taken from a database)
2. Update my scores to an sql database
3. clear the scores in the database

Once completed it should exist as gpa.kanhaprasad.com
